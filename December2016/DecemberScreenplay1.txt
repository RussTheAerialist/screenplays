               The office is the corner office of the building, overlooking
               water.  LINDA, a middle aged woman in business casual
               clothing, is sitting at a desk, eyebrows deeply furrowed as
               she types on her COMPUTER.

               SAM, a young man dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans, opens the
               door, bobbing his head to music playing on oversized
               HEADPHONES.  Linda looks up from her computer.

               He walks to the desk, dropping a LETTER on Linda's desk, and
               then turns around, exiting the office.  Linda stares at his
               butt as he leaves.  She sighs and picks up the letter,
               slicing it open with a LETTER OPENER on her desk.

               She reads the letter and slams it onto her desk.  She picks
               up her phone and slams her fingers into the buttons as she
               dials it.



               EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

               DEVON, a man in his late 40s, is standing behind a waist high
               brick wall with a TROWEL in one hand and a BRICK in another.

               A MID-SIZED SUDAN pulls up to the wall, and LINDA exits the
               passenger-side of car, LETTER in hand.

                                   LINDA
                             (yelling)
                         Devon!

                                   DEVON
                         Ms. Linda, can I help you?

                                   LINDA
                         Where is Alex?

                                   DEVON
                         He's in the trailer.

               Linda walks around the end of the wall, passed Devon, and
               continues to the TRAILER in the background.



               INT. TRAILER - DAY

               The trailer is sparse with a small folding table in the
               corner, and some blueprints on the wall.  ALEX, an older man
               who is overweight, and slightly balding, is sitting in a
               chair with his phone.

               Linda enters and slams the door.

                                   LINDA
                         Goddamn it, Alex.  I told you
                         weren't paying for this stupid
                         wall.

                                   ALEX
                         Linda, babe, sit down.

               Alex motions for a second folding chair.  Linda does not
               move.

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)
                         Fine, stand.  I'll get those
                         portlanders to pay for it.  Don't
                         you worry.

                                   LINDA
                         You keep saying that, but you
                         don't, you can't.  How are you
                         going to do that?

                                   ALEX
                         Listen, babe, those dirty hipsters
                         from PDX, that's what this wall is
                         for.

               Linda throws her hands in the air, and slams them down on the
               desk.

                                   LINDA
                         Are you fucking kidding me?

               Alex walks over to Linda and puts a hand on her shoulder,
               squeezing it.  She pulls away.

                                   LINDA (CONT'D)
                         Get off me.  Done.  We are done.
                         You jack ass.

                                   ALEX
                         Stop being a stupid whore. Just
                         sign the checks.

               Linda punches Alex, and he sprawls out on the ground.  She
               gives him a kick in the side.

                                   LINDA
                         You sexist piece of shit. How dare
                         you talk to me like that!

               Linda kicks him again.

                                   LINDA (CONT'D)
                         Motherfucker.

               Linda walks out of the trailer, slamming the door behind her. 
               Alex continues to writhe in pain.



               INT. CAR - DAY

               SAM is in the driver's seat of the sedan when LINDA opens the
               door and drops into the car.

                                   LINDA
                         I cannot believe that man.  I
                         cannot believe we elected him.

                                   SAM
                         I warned you, but you had to
                         "protest" vote.

               Linda leans back in the car and closes her eyes.

                                   LINDA
                         I know.  I know, but our district
                         should have been safe.

                                   SAM
                         So what? She lost our district
                         because too many protest votes
                         weren't enough to counteract the
                         bigots.

               Linda leans forward.

                                   LINDA
                         Just drive.  I don't need a lecture
                         from you.  You need to sit there,
                         look pretty, and take me home.

                                   SAM
                         Yes, ma'am.
